Capstone RPG
============

This is my capstone project for the Nashville Software School. It uses the Crafty javascript framework to create a small top down rpg environment. You can use the arrow keys to move around.

03/18/2013 - MAJOR REDESIGN
===========================

I have decided to move the project to the limeJS framework. You can run the game by going to the capstone_rpg directory and running the html file there. The current functionality allows the player to move around the screen with a mouseclick or screen tap. If the player moves on top of the wolf, the collision is detected and a fight scene engages.

===============================================
03/18/2012 - More controls, collision detection
===============================================

I have added movement with the arrow keys. I changed the map to be dynamically generated from tile objects. The stone object should have proper collision detection now.
